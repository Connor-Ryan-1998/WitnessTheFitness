# Witness The Fitness [DRAFT]
# Social Collaboratation In The Gym 

## Summary
### Problem identification
The domain the team will be exploring is the lack of social interaction within a casual gym environment. The team will propose and evaluate whether mobile technology can play its role in filling this gap. From research conducted, it is evident that a large portion of gym-goers intentionally isolate themselves from one another, as well as having the feeling that interactions in the gym are intimidating or unnecessary. Our team aims to build friendships, relationships and acquaintances in the gym through our  social and mobile design considerations of a high fidelity prototype.

### Target Audience
As a team we have identified the target audience as young gym-goers who are both experienced and newcomers. In particular, we are aiming our solution at those who attend the gym 3-4 times a week before or after work. Furthermore, these people do not train in class environments and do not know the majority of their gym from other social circles. These people value both social interaction as well as collaboration in the gym environment. From our research and interview data probing conducted, this was reinforced by participants wanting the practice of collaboration and relationship building within the gym environment. We also found with our target audience, their motivation behind this collaboration stemmed from both continuity in their gym routine as well as establishing new relationships with people with similar aligning interests.

### Research Paper Summaries
Prior to design and development the team investigated our domain of social interactions and collaborations in the gym environment. This was firstly by analysing and summarising scholar research papers within the domain. Key findings and ideas is illustrated below:

* Working out in collaboration improves motivation 
* 90% of newcomer gym users drop out in first weeks due to lack of motivation 
* Digital Technology design heuristics support social collaboration
* Existing fitness applications focus primarily on individual fitness progress and sharing workouts rather than building relationships 
* Increased socialising during exercise improves both physical and mental health
* Gamification in fitness applications adds pressure to exercise as well as having the chance of demontivating individuals when they underperform 
* Social collaboration in digital technology flourishes with discussion board, forums and messaging features 
* Team based leaderboards in a non pressured environment evokes collaboration and motivation of each other
* Personal profiles in digital technology feels more relevant to one self 


### Data Collection Analysis 
After establishing the problem space of a lack of social collaboration and interaction that occurs in the gym environment, our team looked towards conducting data collection in order to assist our design direction. The participants included that of young adults aged 16-28 of whom came from either a gym newcomer or experienced background. After conducting an interview and follow up survey the following were the key takeaways:

* Mobile application is a preferred platform when digitally socialising 
* Gym social collaboration would keep gym motivation high
* Competition in the gym can be pressuring for newcomers  
* Experienced gym members seem more difficult to approach 
* Social interactions more accepted when interests, values and practices align 
* Participants value consensus of two parties both wanting to connect for social collaboration or interaction to take place
* Availability was a big value for participants with most having a busy life it was important to them that when they workout with some it is a at routine time
* Leaderboards that were optional and team based would require communication and contribution from each team member 
* People would want to see another full profile before meeting in real life


### Requirements

[1]

Analysing these results, drawing from both research conducted and data collection, the team developed an initial set of design requirements for our low fidelity prototype. These design requirements were flexible to change with  a three phase cycle established at each prototype interaction. In doing so it is expected that our MVP will address the problem space for our target audience. The initial set of design requirements include the following: 

* Mobile Based Application
* Connect individuals based on interests and 2 party conesus 
* Team based leaderboard that is optional  awarding social collaboration 
* Forum and Messaging 
* User profiles 
* Aligned gym schedules between collaborators 
* UI coincides with Nielsen's 10 usability principles

### Low Fidelity Prototype ---> [Figma Model](https://www.figma.com/file/3UpyBwqtW8qMMIbVYR6Uh9/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) 
With this user flow and design requirements the team listed a set of features and functions from this user flow and figma low-fidelity prototype 

### User Testing Evaluation
To understand whether this addressed our target audience's problem space, the team conducted interview testing sessions. The particpants integrated included 5 adults aged 20-26 that were a mix of new and experienced gym goers and mix of genders, of whom consented and signed a consent form to be involved in this project. During this session the target audience participants digitally completed tasks of logging in, creating profile, matching, chatting, viewing leaderboard and collaborating at a gym. At each task, the participants were asked to ‘Think Aloud’. After conducting this test, the following was deduced about our design concept and its requirements.

* Gym schedule didn’t need to exactly match at least once a week wassignificant enough
* Privacy concern some participants comfortable with their local gym being on theirprofile 
* Function issue, some participants use multiple gyms, should include featureTo account for multi-gym users 
* Unhappy with selection of interests choices seemed limiting potential socialinteractions

## Medium Fidelity Prototype
### Medium Fidelity Prototype  ---> [Adobe XD Model](https://xd.adobe.com/view/26fef389-275e-43b5-8dac-a4a43e1d5cce-73ad/grid) 
Considering the feedback from the low-fidelity prototype testing, the team integrated this with subtle design choice changes to address those concerns of participants. The medium-fidelity prototype was constructed in figma. 

### User Testing Evaluation
After developing the figma model with interactions the same participants as previously were given a walkthrough of the prototype. They were then given the tasks of creating an account, matching, chatting, viewing leaderboard, editing profile and collaborating at a gym. Again thinking aloud their comments were recorded. After this a follow up interview and survey was conducted to gauge whether design feedback was addressed as well as how well the prototype addresses the problem space of improving social collaboration and interactions within gyms. The following design and concept feedback was deduced from this user test.  

* Participant feedback supported design of users creating profile and listing interests and workout time to create gym partner matches
* A participant was concerned that there would not be enough people to match with and would make system ineffective
* Some participants disliked idea that their matches were limited by their interests
* Multiple participants expressed concern towards the 'tinder-esque' interface not looking for social collaboration rather romantic relationships 

## High Fidelity Prototype ---> [Mobile Web Application](https://distracted-lalande-3b919e.netlify.app/)
### High Fidelity Prototype
To begin interacting and using the high fedility prototype 
* **Sign Up**
    * To sign up enter any username and password combination to get access to mobile web application
* **Profile**
    * View static details about created acount information
* **My Friends**
    * View freinds added on application
    * View individual friends profile information 
    * Click to message friend
* **Matching**
    * Browse other users in the same session as user
    * Browse other users not in the same session as user
    * View matches user profile and interact to message 
* **Messages**
    * Send and recieve messages from added friends
    * View online/offline status of added friends
    * View time of last message sent/recieved
* **Leaderboard**
    * View scores of top 10 users on leaderboard 
    * View score and rank of your user
    * Interact to send message to ranked leaderboard users  

### User Testing Evaluation
#### **Feedback**
After deploying our web based mobile application, the team intragted the same participants as previously were present in a 'Think Aloud', testing session. As above these users completed tasks in the phases of sign up, profile, my freinds, matching, messages and leaderboard. Once their observations transcripts were written, as post test interview was conducted. Probing participants evaluation of wether our product does improve the social aspect of collaboration in the gym amoung young adults that are either experienced or newcomers to the gym. The following feedback was attained:

* Missing ability to create username instead of email in sign up page would
* Phone number being publically on profile feels invasive
* Gym times of non freinds feels invasive, potential stalking by non-friends
* Gender of male is "Male" and Female is "F", inconsistency
* Users likened apperance of profile organisation of information into personal, interests and sessions
* Users liked towards knowing when a friend is offline/online to not disturb when not wanting to be messaged
* Missing display of whether message is sent or recieved diffcult to communicate by knowing if friend is interested in talking
* Being able to direct message leaders not likened, some leaders may not preffered to be messaged by non-friends
* Missing explanation of how score is attained, would like an FAQ/Help section
* When matching good to display name of gym on main macthing page since single user could use multiple gyms  
* Unessassary add freind on my friends section, assumption don't need to add an already added friend
* Showing career on matches creates another point of interest and point of discussion when talking at gym or messages

#### **Insights**
* From a mobile design perspective we need more considerations for user privacy
* Social Interactions digtially are important in maintaing social relationships
* Communicating digitally prior to physically reduces "awrkwardness" or "breaks the ice"

## Conclusion 
With the process of problem identification, research, user interviews, protyping and evaluation the team was able to develop a solution within our domain. We were able to successfully offer a mobile solution tool that
